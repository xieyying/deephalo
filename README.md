# DeepHalo

**Open-Source Pipeline for High-Confidence and High-throughput Detection of Halogenated Compounds in Complex HRMS Data**

---

## Core Features

### 1. Halogen Prediction
- **Element Prediction Model (EPM)**
  - Dual-branch Isotope Neural Network (IsoNN) architecture
  - High accuracy Cl/Br detection (>98.6% precision)
  - Wide mass range coverage (50-2000 Da)
  - Robust interference resistance to B/Se/Fe/dehydro isomers

### 2. Quality Control System
- **Dual Validation Strategy**
  - Statistical rule-based mass correction
  - Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection Model (ADM) for intensity pattern validation
- **Multi-Level Scoring**
  - Feature-level centroid analysis
  - Scan-level validation
  - H-score integration for peak overlap/saturation error elimination

### 3. Enhanced Dereplication
- **Dual-Strategy Approach**
  - Custom Database Matching
    - Exact mass analysis
    - Halogen presence verification
    - Isotope intensity similarity scoring
  - GNPS Integration
    - MS2 molecular networking
    - Element dimension annotation
    - GraphML file enhancement

##  Technical Advantages

- **High Throughput**
  - Batch analysis of unlimited LC-MS/MS datasets
  - Rapid processing (<30 sec/sample) on standard hardware (Core i9, 16GB RAM)

- **High Accuracy**
  - >98.6% precision in halogen detection
  - Validated across both simulated and experimental LC-MS datasets

- **Comprehensive Integration**
  - Input: Supports `.mzML` format
  - Output: Cytoscape-compatible network files
  - Seamless integration with GNPS molecular networking

- **Enhanced Dereplication**
  - Embeds element detection results into GNPS output GraphML files
  - Significantly higher efficiency compared to molecular networking alone
  - Enables molecular network annotation in the element dimension
