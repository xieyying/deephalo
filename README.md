# DeepHalo: High-Confidence Detection of Halogenated Compounds in Untargeted Metabolomics  
**An open-source pipeline for mining chlorine/bromine-containing natural products from complex HRMS data**

---

##  Core Innovations

### Halogen Prediction
- **Element Prediction Model (EPM)**  
  - Bimodal DNN Architecture  
  - Mass range: 50-2000 Da (wider coverage than existing tools)  
  - Detects Cl/Br with interference resistance to B/Se/Fe/dehydro isomers  

### Isotope Validation
- **Dual detection system**:  
  - Statistical rule-based filtering  
  - Autoencoder Deep Model (ADM) for anomaly detection  

### Multi-Level Scoring
- **H-score integration**:  
  - Feature centroid analysis  
  - Scan-level validation  
  - Eliminates oversaturation/peak overlap errors  

### Dereplication
- **Dual-strategy approach**:  
  1. Custom database matching:  
     - Exact mass  
     - Halogen pattern  
     - Isotope intensity similarity  
  2. MS2 networking via GNPS  
  - Improved identification efficiency  

---

##  Technical Advantages
- **Throughput**: batch analysis of LC-MS/MS datasets with rapid processing times ( <30 sec/sample) on standard laptop hardware (Core i9, 16GB RAM)   
- **Accuracy**: more than 98.6% precision in halogenated compound detection across simulated and experimental LC-MS datasets (n=4)
- **Interoperability**:  
  - Input: `.mzML` 
  - Output: Cytoscape-compatible network files  

---

## Target Applications
- Natural product discovery  
- Halogenated metabolite annotation  

---

## Key Differentiators
1. First tool integrating scan-level halogen validation  
2. Bimodal DNN Architecture for element prediction  
3. Dual dereplication combining:  
   - Custom database matching  
   - MS2 networking
